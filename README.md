apache_role
===========

Apache role that installs my specific weird configuration.

Requirements
------------

* Slackware 14.2
* `slackpkg` configured with an acceptable mirror.
* `become: true`

Role Variables
--------------

The following variables are defined in vars/main.yml:

| Variable         | Default | Description                                                                    |
|:----------------:|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|apache_autostart  | true    |Autostart on server restart?                                                    |
|apache_restart    | true    |(Re)start on install?                                                           |
|apache_ssl_enabled| true    |Base SSL enabled?  Only enables modules.  Certificates are on a per-site basis. |

------------

None

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      become: true
      roles:
         - { role: apache_role }
